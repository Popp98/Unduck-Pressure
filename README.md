# Unduck-Pressure
It's a game made with the python module called "pyxel"

The game was made in 6 hours in groups of 3 students 14 and 15 years old as our first ever game with python during a project called:
La nuit du c0de: https://www.nuitducode.net/

The point of the game is to be a submarine in the ocean fighting against hords of fish going toward him

The submarine can shoot ducks to the fish to kill them but if a fish touche the submarine,
You lose a life

After 3 fish touch your submarines, you're dead (Yeah not the strongest submarine but who cares)

More and more fish will come as the game continue (The may come exponentiolly so really not a lot at the beggining but quickly there is way too much)
